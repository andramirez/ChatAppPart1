#Theme:

The theme of my Chat Room App is cats. I feel that it is a fun and verstile theme that I can implement throughout the app. I was able to do so by tweeking small aspects 
of my project such as the background. Also, instead of a regular bot, I decided to have a 'cat bot' that will occasionally meow at the end of it's responses.

#Acknowledgement of Problems:

Of my various issues with my Chat App, I acknowledge that my app doesn't do the following:
    -Load message list with load of page or connection of user (only loads with make connection button)
    -The user list and count do not properly update on connect and disconnect
    -The Google sign-in button only works on Chrome
    -My chat bot doesn't acknowledge when users leave

#Improvement:

I feel that I could make great improvements given more time. I feel like I was rushed towards the end of this project and I think that with a more spaced out workload, 
I could make much needed improvements for this project including implementing the solutions to the issues I listed above. I also would like to improve on implementing 
the theme more throughout the Chat App itself.
