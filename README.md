#Theme:

The theme of my Chat Room App is cats. I feel that it is a fun and verstile theme that I can implement throughout the app. I was able to do so by tweeking small aspects 
of my project such as the background. Also, instead of a regular bot, I decided to have a 'cat bot' that will occasionally meow at the end of it's responses.

#Acknowledgement of Problems:

Of my various issues with my Chat App, I acknowledge that my app doesn't do the following:
    -Load message list with load of page or connection of user (only loads with make connection button)
    -

#Improvement:

I feel that I could improve my Web App by including a better search query for both the images and the quotes to be more specific to what I want 
them to display. Also, I feel as though I can create a more cohesive theme like authors of a certain genre or authors of a specific time period 
by giving more parameters for filtering the results.
